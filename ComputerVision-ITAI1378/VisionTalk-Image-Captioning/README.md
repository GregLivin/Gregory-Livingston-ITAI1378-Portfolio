# VisionTalk: Image Captioning Program

## 1. Problem Statement
Image captioning is the process of generating natural-language descriptions for images. This project explores how modern AI systems connect visual information (images) with language using a Vision-Language Model (VLM).

## 2. Approach
For this project, I built an image captioning system using the BLIP Vision-Language Model from Hugging Face. The notebook loads the model, processes an input image, and produces a descriptive caption in natural language.

This project demonstrates concepts covered throughout the course, including:

- Image processing  
- Neural networks  
- Convolutional networks  
- Transformers  
- Vision-Language modeling  
- Real-world AI inference workflows
