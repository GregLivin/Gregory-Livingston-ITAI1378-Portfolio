📘 Computer Vision – ITAI 1378

This folder contains my work for the ITAI 1378 – Computer Vision course at Houston Community College.
Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with the foundations and advanced elements of computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning for image-based tasks.

## 🧪 Final Project Included in This Folder  
The final project for this course is:

### **🖼️ VisionTalk – Image Captioning System**  
A BLIP-based vision-language model that:

- Accepts an uploaded image  
- Extracts visual features  
- Generates a natural-language caption  
- Displays the image + predicted caption  

Project folder:  
`./VisionTalk-Image-Captioning/`

It includes:

- Notebook (`.ipynb`)  
- Project README  
- `results/` folder with model outputs
