🚀 Gregory Livingston – Applied AI Portfolio

Houston Community College • Applied Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Program

👨‍💻 About Me

My name is Gregory Livingston, and I am currently pursuing an A.A.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. I am passionate about creating intelligent robotic systems for land, sea, and air that can support humans with tasks across many areas of life.

My interests include advancing AI applications in surgical robotics, aerospace, and defense.

This portfolio highlights the skills and hands-on experience I gained throughout the ITAI 1378 Computer Vision course, along with the practical work I completed during the semester.

📘 Course Overview – ITAI 1378 (Computer Vision)

This course introduced the core concepts of computer vision. Each module expanded my understanding of how machines interpret images and how models can be trained to analyze visual information. I learned how to preprocess images, build simple models, use advanced neural networks, and design a complete AI system that connects vision with language.

My primary course project is listed below.

🖥 Featured Project
VisionTalk – Image Captioning System 📝

This project explores how AI can describe an image using natural language. I used a Vision-Language Model (BLIP) to connect visual features to text generation. The system accepts an image input and produces a short caption describing what it sees.

This project demonstrates my work in:

🔧 Image preprocessing

🧠 Neural network fundamentals

🔄 Transformer-based architectures

🗣 Vision-Language modeling
