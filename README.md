👤 About Me

My name is Gregory Livingston, and I am pursuing an A.A.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.
I am passionate about designing intelligent robotic systems that operate across land, sea, and air to help people in real-world environments.

My interests include:

🏥 Surgical and medical robotics

✈️ Aerospace and autonomous flight systems

🛡️ Defense, safety, and mission-critical robotics

I am also preparing for a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Technology (Mechatronics) to combine AI with engineering and hardware integration.
